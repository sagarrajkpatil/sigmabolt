      "content": "Stud Bolts are externally threaded fasteners without a head, used with 2 nuts on either side, substituting a usual \"bolt & nut\" assembly. Stud bolts are prominently used in flange connections.\n\nDepending upon their design and threading patterns, there are different types of stud bolts as below:\n\n## Continuous Threaded Stud Bolts (Fully Threaded Studs without Chamfered Ends)\n\nStud Bolts with uniform threads over the length are termed as continuous thread stud bolts. This type usually does not carry a chamfered end.\n\n## Tap End Stud Bolts\n\nStud Bolts with unequal length of threads at extreme ends with non-threaded center.\n\n## Double End Stud Bolts\n\nStud Bolts with equal thread lengths at either end with non-threaded center.\n\n## Flange Stud Bolts (Fully Threaded Studs with Chamfered Ends)\n\nThis category stands exclusive for studs bolts used in flange connection with continuous thread over the length and chamfered ends.\n\n## Welding Studs\n\nUnlike others, these are welding studs used with nut on one side and welded to the support on the other.",
