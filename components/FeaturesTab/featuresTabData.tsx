    title: "High Strength",
    desc1: `Strength is a fundamental requirement for all industrial fasteners and bolting components. Certain material grades exhibit significantly higher mechanical properties than standard alloys and are therefore categorized as high tensile or high-strength bolting alloys. These materials are widely used in industries such as commercial and high-performance automotive, aerospace engineering, turbine manufacturing, structural engineering, subsea applications, and more. Common high-strength grades in this category include 8.8, 10.9, 12.9, B7, B16, B21, B24, A490, among others.`,

    title: "High Temperature",
    desc1: `Alloys that maintain high physical and mechanical integrity at elevated temperatures are critically important in the fastener industry. These high-temperature materials are essential for applications such as furnace manufacturing and related equipment, steam turbine production, metal and mineral refining, metal forming, chemical processing, and power generation. Examples of high-temperature bolting alloys include 310 Stainless Steel, Alloy 286, Hastelloy, Inconel, Molybdenum, Waspaloy, Rene 41, as well as various alloy steel grades like Durehete, among others.`,

    title: "Low Temperature",
    desc1: `Fasteners that can withstand significant impact while maintaining their integrity at low temperatures are used in low-temperature bolting applications. These fasteners are typically made from AISI or SAE 4340 alloy and conform to various ASTM specifications, including A320 L43, L7, L7M, B21, B23, and B24.`,

    title: "Weathering Steel",
    desc1: `One of the most important categories of bolting alloys offers high durability and resistance to corrosion and erosion caused by harsh year-round weather conditions. This enhances product lifespan and helps reduce costs. Atmospheric exposure causes the surface to corrode and develop a protective, adherent rust or patina layer that prevents further corrosion. Weathering steel is commonly used to manufacture fasteners for applications such as bridges, industrial roofing, open-framed buildings, and other structural and architectural constructions.`,

    title: "Marine Grade",
    desc1: `Marine-grade bolting materials are specifically designed to resist corrosion and erosion caused by saltwater, while also offering high strength and sometimes low-temperature performance. Commonly used bolting grades in this category include stainless steels and copper alloys. Another option is high-strength alloy steel with corrosion-resistant coatings, engineered to endure the harsh and fluctuating conditions of marine environments. Some of the most frequently used alloys in this category are 316L stainless steel, phosphor bronze, brass, Monel alloy, copper, copper-nickel, and PTFE-coated alloy steel.`,

    title: "Corrosion Resistant",
    desc1: `This category of bolting alloys is characterized by its resistance to general corrosion, intergranular corrosion, localized corrosion, galvanic corrosion, and corrosion cracking caused by various environmental factors. We provide a wide range of bolting and fastener options made from stainless steel alloys, copper alloys, tantalum, zirconium, pure nickel, and other corrosion-resistant nickel-based alloys. Some of these materials offer both excellent corrosion resistance and high-temperature performance, while others are specifically designed to resist stress corrosion cracking, ensuring an extended product lifespan.`,
